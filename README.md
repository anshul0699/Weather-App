# Weather-App

Developed a responsive Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display real-time weather information for any city. The application integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch accurate weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

The core functionality includes:
1) City-based search input with click and Enter key functionality.
2) Dynamic weather display with live API data.
3) Custom icons that change based on weather conditions (e.g., Rain, Clouds, Clear).
4) Responsive design optimized for desktops and mobile devices.
5) Clean UI/UX using modern CSS, gradients, and layout techniques.

Key learnings from the project included:
1) Handling asynchronous API calls using JavaScript's fetch().
2) Parsing and displaying live JSON data on the frontend.
3) Implementing conditional rendering based on real-time data.
4) Designing responsive, user-friendly interfaces from scratch.

The project demonstrates practical knowledge of frontend development, real-time API integration, and DOM manipulation. It serves as a foundation for more advanced applications involving user interaction, external data sources, and responsive design.
